This assignment is about learning methods and how to find the scores of the train and test sets. I learnt how to read dataset from kaggle, how to split the dataset into train and test and more about trees and how to use it. I worked with Muhideen Mustapha on the notebook. I was having some issues connecting my kaggle to the notebook, he helped with that. We also met on how best to show the scores and how hte random state and max depth affect the scores.
