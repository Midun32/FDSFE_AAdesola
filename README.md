What is the reason I decided to take this class?
Computer science is very broad and I am still searching for what I want to focus on full time that I would be comfortable with. Data science is becoming quite popular in the tech industry and personally and career-wise to have the skills would be great for me. Also if I ever want to transition to data science as a full time job, I would have the fundamental knowledge. The main goal is to have different skills and broaden my horizon.

What do I hope to learn the most?
I want to learn to be more observant and take notes of patterns that can help solve a problem. I believe this course would also make me better in decision making becasue I would be able to see the reasoning behind making certain decisions.

What are the strengths in my background or character that I think will help me in the class?
First of all, I would say my patience to be able to read and analyze a bunch of data would help me in this class. Also my willingness to learn new things and be open to acquire new knowledge would continue to be my drive.
