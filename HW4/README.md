This homework was about citibike shared services in NYC and to see if gender or days of the week affected the amount of time poele used citibike for trips. From this assignment, I understood null hypothesis a little better. I also elarnt more about data wrangling. I worked with Muhideen Mustapha on this assignment. Muhideen helped me explain null and alternative hypothesis better then I carried the remaining part of the assignment after understanding.
