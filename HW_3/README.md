This assignment is about the analysis of the happiness scores of various countries and everything that contributes to the happiness score. I used various methods to view the dataset and also created graphical representation of some stats. I worked with Muhideen Mustapha on this assignment. Most of the work was completed by me. I worked with Muhideen to have clarity on somethings that we were asked to do and understand some new tasks given.
