# Part 1
Bad plot:

This plot is bad because firstly, it does not have a title or labels, it is going to be difficult to know the area being reference if one is not familiar with maps. Also the dots used to represent the studies of diarrheal disease done in children (which is what it is about) are very similar. It is hard to distinguish the dots since they are quite close and they are the same color. On first look this plot does not make sense.

Good plot:

This plot is clear, detailed and thorough. Each location is distinguisihed with different color and shapes and the labels are placed in the graph making it easy to inderstand and for reference. The x and y aixs are adequately labeled with standardized units and propperly shows what the plot is displaying, the colors used are needed and not confusing.

Before

This is a bad plot because it does not have title, the graph is showing two things, it is vague and it is difficult for anyone to know which is which.

After

This is after, the plot now has a title, there are labels in the graph that show which bar is for weekend and which one is for weekday. It is more detailed and clear, also the unit for trip duration is now in parathensis.
Caption: This graph shows the trip duration on weekdays vs weekends. It is the unclean version of the data so it is highly skewed to the right. It is showing if the trip duration is characteristically different on weekends than on week days. From the graph, we can see that people take more trips on weekdays but take a little longer trips on weekends.
