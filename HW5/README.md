The linear regression notebook is about the walking speed being proportionial to population size. The task was to check which model fit was better and the test to reject the hypotheis. I learnt more about how p-value can be used.
The multiple linear regression is about the feature and target data of real estates valuations. The task was to create a regression model and find the metrics.
I worked with Muhideen Mustapha on this assignment.
